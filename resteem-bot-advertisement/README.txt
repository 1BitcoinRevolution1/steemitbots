Hi friend!

Here's what you need to do in order to run this program:

1 - Install Node.JS (run 'node-v6.11.1-x86.msi' or download new installer from 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/')
2 - open 'userData.json' and enter your username and password
3 - Double click the RUN icon (or write 'node resteem-bot-advertisement.js' if you use OS-X or Linux)
4 - Leave it running. Every 30 minutes it will scan for new posts to advertise on.
